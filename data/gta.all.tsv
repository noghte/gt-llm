Catalyzes the addition of N-acetylglucosamine in beta 1-4 linkage to the beta-linked mannose of the trimannosyl core of N-linked sugar chains, called bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). It is one of the most important enzymes involved in the regulation of the biosynthesis of glycoprotein oligosaccharides. The addition of this bisecting GlcNAc residue alters not only the composition, but also the conformation of the N-glycan. The introduction of the bisecting GlcNAc residue results in the suppression of further processing and elongation of N-glycans, precluding the formation of beta-1,6 GlcNAc branching, catalyzed by MGAT5 since it is unable to use the bisected oligosaccharide as a substrate (PubMed:19403558). Addition of bisecting N-acetylglucosamine to CDH1/E-cadherin modulates CDH1 cell membrane location (PubMed:19403558). Inhibits NeuAc-alpha-2,3-Gal-beta-1,4-GlcNAc- formation which modulates sialylation levels and plays a role in cell migration regulation (PubMed:26801611).

The assembly of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides begins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and finishes in its lumen. The sequential addition of sugars to dolichol pyrophosphate produces dolichol-linked oligosaccharides containing fourteen sugars, including two GlcNAcs, nine mannoses and three glucoses. Once assembled, the oligosaccharide is transferred from the lipid to nascent proteins by oligosaccharyltransferases. Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase produces dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate/Dol-P-Glc, the glucose donor substrate used sequentially by ALG6, ALG8 and ALG10 to add glucose residues on top of the Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol structure. These are the three last steps in the biosynthetic pathway of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides to produce Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2)-PP-Dol.

GlcCer is the core component of glycosphingolipids/GSLs, amphipathic molecules consisting of a ceramide lipid moiety embedded in the outer leaflet of the membrane, linked to one of hundreds of different externally oriented oligosaccharide structures (PubMed:8643456). Glycosphingolipids are essential components of membrane microdomains that mediate membrane trafficking and signal transduction, implicated in many fundamental cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, migration, morphogenesis, cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions (By similarity). They are required for instance in the proper development and functioning of the nervous system (By similarity).

Known targets include Notch proteins and coagulation factors, such as F9 (PubMed:22117070, PubMed:8982869)

Elongates the glucuronyl-beta-1,4-xylose-beta disaccharide primer structure by adding repeating units [-3-Xylose-alpha-1,3-GlcA-beta-1-] to produce a heteropolysaccharide (By similarity). Supports the maturation of DAG1 more effectively than LARGE1 (PubMed:15752776). In addition, can modify both heparan sulfate (HS)- and chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS)-proteoglycans (PGs), namely GPC4, with a glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-like polysaccharide composed of xylose and glucuronic acid to confer laminin binding (By similarity)

Elongates the glucuronyl-beta-1,4-xylose-beta disaccharide primer structure initiated by B4GAT1 by adding repeating units [-3-Xylose-alpha-1,3-GlcA-beta-1-] to produce a heteropolysaccharide (PubMed:22223806, PubMed:23125099, PubMed:25138275, PubMed:25279697, PubMed:25279699, PubMed:32975514). Requires the phosphorylation of core M3 (O-mannosyl trisaccharide) by POMK to elongate the glucuronyl-beta-1,4-xylose-beta disaccharide primer (PubMed:21987822). Plays a key role in skeletal muscle function and regeneration (By similarity)
