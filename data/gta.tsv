3	GT-A	GT13	GT13-MGAT1	MGAT1	P26572	Alpha-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 2-beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase	GGNT1;GLCT1;GLYT1;MGAT	N-glycosyl-oligosaccharide-glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I	Initiates complex N-linked carbohydrate formation. Essential for the conversion of high-mannose to hybrid and complex N-glycans
4	GT-A	GT13	GT13-POMGNT1	POMGNT1	Q8WZA1	Protein O-linked-mannose beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1	MGAT1.2	UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I.2	Participates in O-mannosyl glycosylation by catalyzing the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to O-linked mannose on glycoproteins (PubMed:11709191, PubMed:27493216, PubMed:28512129). Catalyzes the synthesis of the GlcNAc(beta1-2)Man(alpha1-)O-Ser/Thr moiety on alpha-dystroglycan and other O-mannosylated proteins, providing the necessary basis for the addition of further carbohydrate moieties (PubMed:11709191, PubMed:27493216). Is specific for alpha linked terminal mannose and does not have MGAT3, MGAT4, MGAT5, MGAT7 or MGAT8 activity
