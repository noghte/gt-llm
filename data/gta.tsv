1	GT-A	GT12	GT12-1	B4GALNT1	Q00973	Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1	GALGT;SIAT2	(N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosylglucosylceramide;GM2/GD2 synthase;GalNAc-T	Involved in the biosynthesis of gangliosides GM2, GD2, GT2 and GA2 from GM3, GD3, GT3 and GA3, respectively
2	GT-A	GT12	GT12-1	B4GALNT2	Q8NHY0	Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2	GALGT2	Sd(a) beta-1,4-GalNAc transferase;UDP-GalNAc:Neu5Aca2-3Galb-R b1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase	Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of Sd(a) histo-blood group antigen. Catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) group in a beta-1,4-linkage from UDP-GalNAc to the galactose residue of NeuAcalpha2->3Gal-R to form Sd(a) glycan epitope GalNAcbeta1->4(NeuAcalpha2->3)Gal-R. The Sd(a) epitope is carried in O- and N-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids, including O-linked core 1 structures on GYPA/glycophorin, SLC4A1 and SLC29A1 in erythrocytes, N-linked glycans attached to the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein UMOD/uromodulin in renal fluids, O-linked core 3 glycans on mucins in colon and neolactosides in gastric mucosa (PubMed:12678917, PubMed:14688233, PubMed:16024623, PubMed:35409292). Confers protection against influenza A virus strains that attach to NeuAcalpha2->3-carrying host receptors. Modifies N-glycan chains on host receptors and prevents virus entry into cells (PubMed:28813663)

Essential for the conversion of high-mannose to hybrid and complex N-glycans
4	GT-A	GT13	GT13-POMGNT1	POMGNT1	Q8WZA1	Protein O-linked-mannose beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1	MGAT1.2	UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I.2	Participates in O-mannosyl glycosylation by catalyzing the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to O-linked mannose on glycoproteins (PubMed:11709191, PubMed:27493216, PubMed:28512129). Catalyzes the synthesis of the GlcNAc(beta1-2)Man(alpha1-)O-Ser/Thr moiety on alpha-dystroglycan and other O-mannosylated proteins, providing the necessary basis for the addition of further carbohydrate moieties (PubMed:11709191, PubMed:27493216). Is specific for alpha linked terminal mannose and does not have MGAT3, MGAT4, MGAT5, MGAT7 or MGAT8 activity
5	GT-A	GT14	GT14-1	GCNT1	Q02742	Beta-1,3-galactosyl-O-glycosyl-glycoprotein beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase	NACGT2	Core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase;Core 2-branching enzyme;Core2-GlcNAc-transferase;Leukocyte type core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase	Glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moiety in beta1-6 linkage from UDP-GlcNAc onto mucin-type core 1 O-glycan to form the branched mucin-type core 2 O-glycan (PubMed:1329093, PubMed:23027862). The catalysis is metal ion-independent and occurs with inversion of the anomeric configuration of sugar donor (By similarity). Selectively involved in synthesis of mucin-type core 2 O-glycans that serve as scaffolds for the display of selectin ligand sialyl Lewis X epitope by myeloid cells, with an impact on homeostasis and recruitment to inflammatory sites (By similarity). Can also act on glycolipid substrates. Transfers GlcNAc moiety to GalGb4Cer globosides in a reaction step to the synthesis of stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) determinant (By similarity). Can use Galbeta1-3GalNAcalpha1- and Galbeta1-3GalNAcbeta1- oligosaccharide derivatives as acceptor substrates (By similarity)
