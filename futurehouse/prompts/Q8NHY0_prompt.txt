# Information

**Protein Name: Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 / gene: B4GALNT2 GALGT2**
**Uniprot Id: Q8NHY0**
**Protein alternative names: Sd(a) beta-1,4-GalNAc transferase;UDP-GalNAc:Neu5Aca2-3Galb-R b1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase**
**Protein Function: Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of Sd(a) histo-blood group antigen. Catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) group in a beta-1,4-linkage from UDP-GalNAc to the galactose residue of NeuAcalpha2->3Gal-R to form Sd(a) glycan epitope GalNAcbeta1->4(NeuAcalpha2->3)Gal-R. The Sd(a) epitope is carried in O- and N-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids, including O-linked core 1 structures on GYPA/glycophorin, SLC4A1 and SLC29A1 in erythrocytes, N-linked glycans attached to the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein UMOD/uromodulin in renal fluids, O-linked core 3 glycans on mucins in colon and neolactosides in gastric mucosa (PubMed:12678917, PubMed:14688233, PubMed:16024623, PubMed:35409292). Confers protection against influenza A virus strains that attach to NeuAcalpha2->3-carrying host receptors. Modifies N-glycan chains on host receptors and prevents virus entry into cells (PubMed:28813663)**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
