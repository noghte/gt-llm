# Information

**Protein Name: Protein O-linked-mannose beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 / gene: POMGNT1 MGAT1.2**
**Uniprot Id: Q8WZA1**
**Protein alternative names: UDP-GlcNAc:alpha-D-mannoside beta-1,2-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I.2**
**Protein Function: Participates in O-mannosyl glycosylation by catalyzing the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to O-linked mannose on glycoproteins (PubMed:11709191, PubMed:27493216, PubMed:28512129). Catalyzes the synthesis of the GlcNAc(beta1-2)Man(alpha1-)O-Ser/Thr moiety on alpha-dystroglycan and other O-mannosylated proteins, providing the necessary basis for the addition of further carbohydrate moieties (PubMed:11709191, PubMed:27493216). Is specific for alpha linked terminal mannose and does not have MGAT3, MGAT4, MGAT5, MGAT7 or MGAT8 activity**

Develop a **comprehensive nomenclature and functional profile** for the protein introduced in the Information section, strictly following the **Reference Template** in structure and formatting. The output should mirror the organization and style of the template, without introducing new sections such as "Summary" or "Conclusion".
Also, do not interpret results. For example **DO NOT** add sentences to interpret the findings (such as **suggesting that**, etc.)
ONLY consider publications and ignore clinical trials/patents/opentargets.
Prioritize articles with a higher number of citations and prioritize domain leading or highest impact journals.

This template provides an example of expected **section headers, structure and writing tone**. Use it solely to guide the format. You are encouraged to improve the depth and comprehensiveness of your response without being repetitive and speculative.
