  "B4GALNT1": "## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  \n2.4.1.92  \n\n## Accepted name  \nBeta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1  \n\n## Synonyms  \nGM2 synthase, GM2/GD2 synthase, GalNAc-T, (N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosylglucosylceramide transferase  \n\n## Phylogeny  \nB4GALNT1 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, with known orthologs in species such as humans, mice, and rats. Phylogenetic analyses reveal significant sequence conservation with other glycosyltransferases involved in ganglioside synthesis, indicating its essential role in the formation of complex glycolipids in the nervous system. B4GALNT1 is classified within the GT31 family of glycosyltransferases, which specialize in glycolipid modification.  \n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nGT31  \n\n## Reaction catalyzed  \nThe enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-GalNAc to glycolipid acceptors, converting GM3, GD3, GT3, and GA3 into GM2, GD2, GT2, and GA2, respectively.  \n\n## Cofactor requirements  \nB4GALNT1 requires manganese ions (Mn²⁺) for its catalytic activity.  \n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nB4GALNT1 specifically acts on glycolipid substrates, particularly those that are precursors to complex gangliosides. It incorporates an N-acetylgalactosamine residue into gangliosides such as GM3, GD3, GT3, and GA3, generating GM2, GD2, GT2, and GA2. The enzyme does not exhibit activity toward glycoprotein substrates.  \n\n## Structure  \nB4GALNT1 is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase localized in the Golgi apparatus. It features a short cytosolic tail, a single transmembrane helix, and a large C-terminal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain contains conserved motifs, including a DXD motif critical for metal ion coordination and donor substrate binding. Structural studies suggest that the catalytic domain adopts a GT-A fold, although no experimentally solved 3D structure is currently available. The enzyme forms homodimers, which are important for its enzymatic function and localization.  \n\n## Regulation  \nB4GALNT1 is regulated at multiple levels, including transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. The gene undergoes alternative splicing, producing transcripts with varying N-terminal domains that may influence subcellular localization. Post-translational modifications, particularly N-glycosylation at three critical sites, are essential for the enzyme's maturation and activity. Increased expression of B4GALNT1 has been observed in malignant melanomas and certain T cell subsets, indicating a response to cellular transformation and immune activation.  \n\n## Function  \nB4GALNT1 is crucial for the biosynthesis of complex gangliosides, which are vital components of neural cell membranes. The enzyme's activity is essential for the development and function of the nervous system, as it participates in cell–cell recognition and signal transduction. B4GALNT1 is predominantly expressed in neural tissues, correlating with the enrichment of gangliosides in these areas. Aberrant expression of B4GALNT1 has been linked to various cancers, suggesting its role in tumor cell behavior.  \n\n## Disease relevance  \nLoss-of-function variants in B4GALNT1 are associated with early-onset complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, characterized by impaired ganglioside synthesis and neurological deficits. Increased expression of B4GALNT1 has been noted in adult T-cell leukemia, neuroblastomas, and malignant melanomas, indicating that dysregulation of ganglioside biosynthesis may contribute to tumor progression.  \n\n## Other comments  \nB4GALNT1 exclusively acts on glycolipid substrates and does not exhibit activity toward glycoprotein acceptors. The enzyme's expression is under complex regulatory control, including alternative promoter usage and splicing. Although detailed structural data from X-ray crystallography are not yet available, modeling studies suggest that the catalytic domain adopts a GT-A-like fold. The strict requirement for Mn²⁺ and the enzyme's specificity for ganglioside substrates highlight its critical role in the neural ganglioside biosynthetic pathway.  \n\n## References  \n1.

  "B4GALNT2": "## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  \nThe accepted enzyme commission classification for Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 is EC 2.4.1.244. This classification reflects its role as a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylgalactosamine moiety from UDP-GalNAc to an acceptor glycan (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Accepted name  \nThe recommended name for this protein is “Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2.” It is also known as Sd(a) beta-1,4-GalNAc transferase or UDP-GalNAc:Neu5Aca2–3Galb-R β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, reflecting its function in synthesizing the Sd(a) histo-blood group antigen (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Phylogeny  \nBeta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, with orthologs identified in species such as humans, mice, and pigs (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that this enzyme is part of a conserved branch of glycosyltransferases involved in glycan antigen biosynthesis (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-4). B4GALNT2 is related to other glycosyltransferases, particularly B4GALNT1, which synthesizes ganglioside GM2, highlighting its unique catalytic specificity (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nB4GALNT2 belongs to the glycosyltransferase family GT31 within the CAZy classification, which includes enzymes that catalyze glycosyl transfer reactions (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-5).\n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nBeta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue in a β1,4-linkage from UDP-GalNAc to the galactose residue of an acceptor glycan featuring a terminal Neu5Acα2–3. The product formed is the Sd(a) antigen, represented as GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Gal-R (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4).\n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of B4GALNT2 requires divalent metal ions, specifically Mn²⁺, which are essential for stabilizing the nucleotide sugar donor complex (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11).\n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nB4GALNT2 exhibits strict substrate specificity, requiring the acceptor substrate to possess an α2,3-linked sialic acid attached to a galactose residue. It acts on various glycan classes, including type 1 and type 2 lactosaminic chains, core 2 and core 3 O-linked glycans, and glycolipids, while showing no activity towards substrates with α2,6-linked sialic acids (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3).\n\n## Structure  \nThe 3D structure of B4GALNT2 has been characterized using experimental and computational methods, revealing a type II transmembrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, and a large catalytic domain located in the Golgi lumen. The enzyme exists in two isoforms, with the short form exhibiting higher enzymatic activity. Key structural features include the conserved DxD motif for metal ion binding and UDP-GalNAc coordination, as well as cysteine residues that may contribute to dimerization (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms for B4GALNT2 involve transcriptional and post-translational modifications. Transcriptionally, alternative promoter usage leads to distinct isoforms, and DNA methylation is a significant modulator of expression. Post-translationally, B4GALNT2 undergoes N-glycosylation critical for proper folding and stability, and the extended cytoplasmic tail contains motifs that facilitate Golgi retention and post-Golgi trafficking (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 17-20, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 1-3).\n\n## Function  \nB4GALNT2 is crucial for the biosynthesis of the Sd(a) histo-blood group antigen, influencing glycan composition on cell surface molecules. It is predominantly expressed in the colon, contributing to mucin-type O-glycans and core 3 structures. The Sd(a) antigen plays roles in cell recognition, pathogen adhesion protection, and influenza A virus entry modulation (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9).\n\n## Inhibitors  \nNo specific inhibitors for B4GALNT2 have been reported in the literature available from the provided sources (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9).\n\n## Disease relevance  \nB4GALNT2 expression is notably down-regulated in colorectal cancer, correlating with tumor progression and patient survival outcomes. Its activity affects the balance between Sd(a) and sialyl Lewis x antigens, influencing cancer cell adhesion and metastatic potential (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 109-112).\n\n## Other Comments  \nThe functional profile of B4GALNT2 is influenced by its isoform complexity, with alternative transcription initiation leading to variants that affect localization and activity. A unique non-consensus N-glycosylation site is critical for folding and dimer formation, adding a regulatory layer to its function (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14). The enzyme's tissue-specific expression in the colon underscores its role in mucosal biology and epithelial integrity (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9).\n\n## References  \n1.

  "GCNT1": "## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  \n2.4.1.102  \n\n## Accepted name  \nCore 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase  \n\n## Synonyms  \nCore 2-branching enzyme; Core2 GlcNAc-transferase; Leukocyte type core 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase  \n\n## Phylogeny  \nGCNT1 is conserved across various mammalian species, including mouse, rat, and cattle, indicating its essential role in mucin-type O-glycosylation pathways (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 15-17, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). It shares significant sequence identity (approximately 40–50%) with isoenzymes such as Core2GlcNAcT-III, reflecting preserved catalytic mechanisms among core-branching glycosyltransferases (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). Phylogenetic analyses place GCNT1 within a group of glycosyltransferases involved in the elongation and branching of O-glycans, highlighting its evolutionary conservation across metazoans (schjoldager2020globalviewof pages 6-6, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151).  \n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nGT14  \n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nGCNT1 catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) unit from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to the 6-hydroxyl group of the galactose residue in a mucin-type core 1 O-glycan, resulting in the formation of core 2 O-glycans. The reaction can be summarized as follows:  \nUDP-GlcNAc + Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr → UDP + Galβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1-6)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151).  \n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nGCNT1 operates independently of metal ions, distinguishing it from many glycosyltransferases that require divalent metal ions (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6).  \n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nGCNT1 preferentially acts on mucin-type core 1 O-glycan motifs, specifically recognizing Galβ1-3GalNAc structures linked to serine or threonine residues (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). It can also transfer GlcNAc to glycolipid substrates, such as GalGb4Cer globosides, contributing to the biosynthesis of stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) determinants (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 15-17, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151).  \n\n## Structure  \nGCNT1 is a type II transmembrane protein characterized by a short N-terminal cytosolic tail, a single transmembrane domain, a stem region with potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and a large lumenal catalytic domain (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). The catalytic domain adopts a GT-A fold, featuring a central mixed β-sheet and α-helices, with key catalytic residues including a free cysteine (Cys217) and glutamic acid (Glu320) that facilitate substrate binding and catalysis (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 25-30, pak2011structuralandmechanistic pages 11-12).  \n\n## Regulation  \nGCNT1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by factors such as Sp1 and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-15) in activated T-cells (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 30-36). Post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation, influence its stability and localization within the Golgi (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). Additionally, substrate availability and competition with other glycosyltransferases can modulate GCNT1 activity (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151).  \n\n## Function  \nGCNT1 is crucial for synthesizing mucin-type core 2 O-glycans, which serve as scaffolds for complex glycan structures, including selectin ligands essential for leukocyte adhesion and migration (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). It is predominantly expressed in leukocytes, particularly activated T-cells, highlighting its role in immune responses (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 30-36).  \n\n## Disease relevance  \nGCNT1 has been implicated in various cancers, with increased expression correlating with aggressive tumor behavior and altered glycan structures affecting cell adhesion and immune interactions (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 14-15, dimitroff2019ibranchedcarbohydratesas pages 3-4). Dysregulation of GCNT1-mediated glycosylation may contribute to immune-related syndromes, including AIDS and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151).  \n\n## Other Comments  \nGCNT1 demonstrates substrate flexibility, acting on both protein and glycolipid substrates, which contributes to the diversity of glycoconjugates (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 1-2, hodgson2023theroleof pages 9-10). Recombinant expression systems have been utilized for biochemical analyses, and viral homologs with high sequence identity suggest evolutionary adaptations in glycosylation pathways (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156).  \n\n## References  \n1.
