This EC designation reflects its role in transferring an N-acetylgalactosamine moiety from UDP-GalNAc to specific glycolipid acceptors (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49). The enzyme’s classification under EC 2.4.1.92 is based on rigorous biochemical characterization that demonstrates its specificity for glycolipid substrates rather than glycoproteins (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). EC 2.4.1.92 distinguishes B4GALNT1 from other glycosyltransferases that transfer different sugars or catalyze glycosidic bonds with alternate anomeric configurations (hennet2002thegalactosyltransferasefamily pages 12-13, li2018congenitaldisordersof pages 1-4). This value is supported by kinetic assays and substrate reactions that define the enzyme’s functional role in ganglioside biosynthesis (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190).\n\n## Accepted name  \nThe recommended and accepted name for the enzyme is Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1. This designation is accompanied by alternative names such as GM2 synthase, GM2/GD2 synthase, and GalNAc-T, reflecting its activity in ganglioside biosynthesis (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). Additional synonyms including (N-acetylneuraminyl)-galactosylglucosylceramide transferase emphasize its substrate context and catalytic function (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49, unknownauthors2003molecularcloninggene pages 9-10). These designations are consistent across multiple publications and databases, with the accepted name being used in biochemical and genetic studies (hennet2002thegalactosyltransferasefamily pages 12-13, alecu2022functionalvalidationof pages 5-7).\n\n## Phylogeny  \nB4GALNT1 is evolutionarily conserved across vertebrates, and orthologs have been identified in species such as human, mouse, and rat (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, alecu2022functionalvalidationof pages 5-7). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that this enzyme shares significant sequence conservation with other glycosyltransferases involved in the synthesis of gangliosides, underscoring its essential role in the formation of complex glycolipids in the nervous system (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 6-7, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 11-12). Within the animal kingdom, B4GALNT1 clusters in a distinct subgroup of glycosyltransferases that specialize in glycolipid modification, and its sequence conservation suggests a common ancestral gene from which other GT31 family members have diverged (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-5, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 11-12). In evolutionary context, the conservation of catalytic motifs such as the DXD motif and key amino acid residues in the catalytic domain reflects its preserved functional role across divergent metazoan lineages (breton1999structurefunctionstudiesof pages 8-8, breton1999structurefunctionstudiesof pages 5-7).\n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nB4GALNT1 belongs to the CAZy glycosyltransferase family GT31, a group of enzymes that are involved predominantly in glycolipid and glycoprotein biosynthesis (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-5, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 11-12). Members of the GT31 family are characterized by conserved domain structures, including a catalytic domain that adopts a GT-A fold, and a specific set of conserved sequence motifs such as the DXD motif critical for metal ion coordination and donor substrate binding (breton2001structuralandfunctional pages 2-4, breton1999structurefunctionstudiesof pages 3-4). The enzyme is grouped with other β1,4-galactosyltransferases that share similar substrate specificities and domain organizations, distinguishing its activity from enzymes in other CAZy families (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16). This family assignment is supported by phylogenetic studies that consistently place B4GALNT1 in the context of ganglioside synthesizing enzymes (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 11-12).\n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nThe enzyme catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from the nucleotide sugar donor UDP-GalNAc to specific glycolipid acceptors. In this reaction, B4GALNT1 converts ganglioside precursors such as GM3, GD3, GT3, and GA3 into the more complex species GM2, GD2, GT2, and GA2, respectively (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49). The reaction proceeds via the formation of a β1,4-glycosidic linkage, and it is central to the biosynthetic pathways that generate the gangliosides enriched in neural tissues (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 3-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187). The enzyme exhibits strict donor specificity for UDP-GalNAc, and its acceptor specificity for glycolipids underlines its role in the ganglio-series biosynthetic cascade (unknownauthors2016investigatingthebiological pages 16-20, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190).\n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nB4GALNT1 requires divalent metal ions as cofactors for its catalytic activity. In particular, its activity is dependent on the presence of manganese ions (Mn²⁺), which are essential for coordinating the UDP-GalNAc donor substrate via conserved amino acid residues in the catalytic domain (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49). This requirement for Mn²⁺ is a common feature among glycosyltransferases, and it plays a critical role in stabilizing the transition state during the transfer reaction (breton1999structurefunctionstudiesof pages 3-4, kapitonov1999conserveddomainsof pages 1-2). The ionic cofactor binds in conjunction with the conserved DXD motif, thus facilitating the proper orientation of the donor substrate for efficient catalysis (breton2001structuralandfunctional pages 2-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187).\n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nThe substrate specificity of B4GALNT1 is marked by its exclusive action on glycolipid substrates, particularly those that are precursors to complex gangliosides. The enzyme recognizes and acts on gangliosides such as GM3, GD3, GT3, and GA3, incorporating an N-acetylgalactosamine residue to generate GM2, GD2, GT2, and GA2, respectively (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). B4GALNT1 does not exhibit activity toward glycoprotein substrates, and its substrate specificity is determined by the configuration of the acceptor glycolipid, which includes a terminal sialylated galactose residue (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49). Kinetic studies indicate that the enzyme demonstrates distinct affinity parameters for different glycolipid acceptors, with reported differences in Km and Vmax values when using substrates such as GM3 versus lactosylceramide (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187). The strict specificity for glycolipid substrates plays a crucial role in directing the biosynthetic flow toward the formation of gangliosides that are pivotal in neural function (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190).\n\n## Structure  \nB4GALNT1 is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase localized in the Golgi apparatus, and its structure is organized into several distinct domains. The N-terminal region comprises a short cytosolic tail followed by a single transmembrane helix that anchors the enzyme to the Golgi membrane, while a stem region links the transmembrane segment to the large C-terminal catalytic domain (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, pqac-f9b0fcfa). The catalytic domain contains conserved motifs, including a DXD motif that coordinates the Mn²⁺ cofactor and binds the UDP-GalNAc donor substrate (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). Structural studies and in silico modeling indicate that the catalytic domain likely adopts a GT-A fold characterized by a Rossmann-like structure, although an experimentally solved 3D structure is not yet available (breton2001structuralandfunctional pages 2-4, breton1999structurefunctionstudiesof pages 3-4). The enzyme is known to form homodimers, a configuration that is believed to be important for its enzymatic function and proper localization within the Golgi (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). Additionally, three distinct N-glycosylation sites have been identified within the catalytic domain, and these modifications are necessary for full enzymatic activity, proper folding, and stability (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, pqac-f9b0fcfa).\n\n## Regulation  \nRegulation of B4GALNT1 occurs at multiple molecular levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms. The gene encoding B4GALNT1 produces alternatively spliced transcripts that differ in the length of their N-terminal cytosolic domains, a feature that has been associated with distinct subcellular distributions and potentially differential regulatory control (pqac-f9b0fcfa, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187). Post-translationally, the enzyme is extensively N-glycosylated at three critical sites; these N-glycans are essential for the maturation, stability, and full catalytic activity of B4GALNT1 (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190, unknownauthors2003molecularcloninggene pages 9-10). Transcriptional regulation is evident through promoter usage and alternative splicing, and activation by factors such as the p40tax protein encoded by human T-lymphotropic virus type I has been reported (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187). Moreover, increased expression of B4GALNT1 has been observed in malignant melanomas and certain differentiated T cell subsets, implying that its regulation is also responsive to cellular transformation states and immune activation (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). Dimerization through specific domain interactions further contributes to its regulation by affecting enzyme stability and possibly substrate channeling within ganglioside biosynthetic pathways (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, pqac-f9b0fcfa).\n\n## Function  \nB4GALNT1 plays a critical role in the biosynthesis of complex gangliosides that are essential components of neural cell membranes. The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylgalactosamine residue from UDP-GalNAc to simpler glycolipid substrates such as GM3, GD3, GT3, and GA3, thereby producing more complex gangliosides including GM2, GD2, GT2, and GA2 (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49). The formation of these gangliosides is fundamental to the development, maintenance, and function of the nervous system, as they participate in cell–cell recognition, signal transduction, and modulation of membrane protein activities (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 3-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187). Expression of B4GALNT1 is predominantly high in neural tissues such as the brain, hippocampus, and retina, correlating with the known enrichment of gangliosides in these areas (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, pqac-9213270a). In addition to its central role in normal neural physiology, aberrant expression of B4GALNT1 has been documented in various cancers, including malignant melanomas, neuroblastomas, and adult T-cell leukemia, which suggests that alterations in ganglioside composition may influence tumor cell behavior (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, alecu2022functionalvalidationof pages 5-7). B4GALNT1 functions within a coordinated network of glycosyltransferases that sequentially modify glycolipid precursors in the Golgi apparatus, thereby establishing the diverse ganglioside repertoire required for proper neuronal function (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190).\n\n## Inhibitors  \nNo specific inhibitors for B4GALNT1 have been reported in the reviewed literature, and therefore this section is omitted.\n\n## Disease relevance  \nAlterations in B4GALNT1 expression and function are associated with a range of neuropathological conditions. Loss-of-function variants in B4GALNT1 have been linked to early-onset complex hereditary spastic paraplegia, characterized by impaired ganglioside synthesis, developmental delays, and neurological deficits (hennet2002thegalactosyltransferasefamily pages 12-13, alecu2022functionalvalidationof pages 5-7). Additionally, increased expression levels of this enzyme have been observed in adult T-cell leukemia, certain neuroblastomas, gliomas, and malignant melanomas, indicating that dysregulation of ganglioside biosynthesis may contribute to tumor progression and altered cell signaling in cancer (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, pqac-ba45b933). These findings underscore the clinical significance of B4GALNT1 and suggest that aberrant ganglioside profiles, resulting from mutations or altered expression of this enzyme, may have profound effects on neural function and oncogenic processes (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, alecu2022functionalvalidationof pages 5-7).\n\n## Other Comments  \nThe enzymatic activity of B4GALNT1 is entirely restricted to glycolipid substrates, and it exhibits no detectable activity toward glycoprotein acceptors; this substrate specificity is a distinguishing feature among glycosyltransferases involved in ganglioside metabolism (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). The B4GALNT1 gene is expressed under complex regulatory control, which includes alternative promoter usage and splicing that yield multiple transcript variants with distinct N-terminal domains (pqac-f9b0fcfa, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187). Although detailed three-dimensional structural data from X-ray crystallography are not yet available, AlphaFold2-based and homology modeling studies suggest that the catalytic domain adopts a GT-A-like fold featuring the characteristic Rossmann-like nucleotide-binding region and an extended acceptor-binding pocket (breton2001structuralandfunctional pages 2-4, breton1999structurefunctionstudiesof pages 3-4). Dimerization appears to be an important aspect of its structure and function, potentially influencing both enzymatic activity and proper Golgi localization (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 187-190). Furthermore, the strict metal cofactor requirement for Mn²⁺, in concert with essential amino acid residues such as those in the DXD motif, highlights the precise mechanistic features that underpin B4GALNT1’s catalytic action (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 45-49). The enzyme’s exclusive specificity for ganglioside substrates and its pivotal role in the neural ganglioside biosynthetic pathway make it an important target for studies in neurobiology and cancer biology, and ongoing research aims to further elucidate its structural and regulatory features (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187, alecu2022functionalvalidationof pages 5-7, pqac-663ca403).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

This assignment reflects its biochemical role as a glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of an N‐acetylgalactosamine moiety from a nucleotide sugar donor to an acceptor glycan bearing a terminal sialylated galactose residue (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16).\n\n## Accepted name  \nThe recommended name for this protein is “Beta‐1,4 N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2.” It is also referred to as Sd(a) beta‐1,4‐GalNAc transferase or UDP‐GalNAc:Neu5Aca2–3Galb‐R β1,4‐N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, reflecting its catalytic function in synthesizing the Sd(a) histo‐blood group antigen (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2023thestoryof pages 3-4, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Phylogeny  \nBeta‐1,4 N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, with well‐documented orthologs in human, mouse, pig, and other mammalian species (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). Phylogenetic analyses place this enzyme within a conserved branch of glycosyltransferases that participate in the biosynthesis of glycan antigens on both glycoproteins and glycolipids (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 16-16). Within the broader context of glycan‐modifying enzymes, B4GALNT2 shows evolutionary relationships with closely related paralogs such as B4GALNT1, which synthesizes ganglioside GM2, yet its catalytic specificity and tissue distribution distinguish it functionally (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). The gene is located on chromosome 17q21.33 and consists of multiple coding exons that have evolved by alternative exon usage to yield distinct isoforms (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nB4GALNT2 belongs to the glycosyltransferase family GT31 within the CAZy classification. This family comprises enzymes that generally catalyze glycosyl transfer reactions via either retaining or inverting mechanisms. In particular, B4GALNT2 is grouped with other beta‐1,4‐N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferases that participate in the biosynthesis of blood group antigens and complex glycan structures (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-5, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16).\n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nBeta‐1,4 N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 catalyzes the transfer of an N‐acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue in a β1,4‐linkage from the donor substrate UDP‐GalNAc to the galactose residue of an acceptor glycan that features a terminal Neu5Acα2–3 linked sialic acid. The resulting product is the Sd(a) antigen, with the structure GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Gal‐R, which is displayed on both N‐ and O‐linked glycoproteins as well as glycolipids. This transfer reaction is critical for the biosynthesis of a distinct histo‐blood group antigen (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of B4GALNT2 is dependent on divalent metal ion cofactors, with a requirement for ions such as Mn²⁺ (and in some cases Mg²⁺ is considered) that are essential for stabilizing the nucleotide sugar donor complex. The conserved DxD motif in the enzyme coordinates these metal ions, thereby facilitating the proper binding of UDP‐GalNAc during the transfer reaction (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16, pqac-23e3b47b).\n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nB4GALNT2 displays strict substrate specificity that requires the acceptor substrate to possess an α2,3‐linked sialic acid attached to a galactose residue. It acts on multiple glycan classes, including type 1 and type 2 lactosaminic chains, core 2 and core 3 O‐linked glycans, and glycolipids such as those found in sialylparagloboside. The enzyme does not catalyze the transfer of GalNAc to substrates with α2,6‐linked sialic acids or gangliosides like GM3, emphasizing its selectivity for α2,3‐sialylated structures (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 14-15, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Structure  \nThe domain organization of B4GALNT2 has been characterized both experimentally and through computational modeling using tools such as AlphaFold2. The protein is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, comprising a short cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large catalytic domain located in the Golgi lumen. Two major isoforms are produced by alternative first exon usage: a short form of 506 amino acids, which exhibits higher enzymatic activity, and a long form of 566 amino acids that contains an extended cytoplasmic tail critical for additional post‐Golgi vesicle targeting (groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). The catalytic domain contains the typical glycosyltransferase motifs, including the conserved DxD motif integral for metal ion binding and UDP‐GalNAc coordination, as well as conserved cysteine residues that likely contribute to intersubunit disulfide bonding and homodimer formation (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 1-2, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). Structural modeling indicates that the catalytic pocket remains accessible despite the presence of bulky N‐glycans at non‐consensus N‐glycosylation sites, thereby ensuring efficient catalysis (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11). The extended cytoplasmic tail of the long isoform contains sorting signals, such as an ER‐exit dibasic RGR motif and a vesicular targeting heptapeptide, which facilitate its localization to post‐Golgi vesicles and the plasma membrane in addition to the Golgi (groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 17-20, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12).\n\n## Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms controlling B4GALNT2 expression and activity occur at both the transcriptional and post‐translational levels. Transcriptional regulation involves alternative promoter usage leading to the production of distinct isoforms (exon 1S versus exon 1L), and the presence of CpG islands upstream of these exons indicates that DNA methylation is an important modulator of gene expression. Moreover, transcription factors such as ETS1, DMTF1, and SP1 have been reported to contribute to B4GALNT2 regulation (groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 17-20, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 3-4). At the post‐translational level, B4GALNT2 undergoes N‐glycosylation at an atypical, evolutionarily conserved non‐consensus N‐X‐C motif, and this glycosylation is critical for proper protein folding, homodimerization, stability, and correct targeting to the Golgi apparatus (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 1-3, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11). In addition, the extended cytoplasmic tail in the long isoform contains specific motifs that not only modulate Golgi retention but also facilitate dynamic post‐Golgi trafficking, underscoring the importance of subcellular localization in the enzyme’s functional regulation (groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12).\n\n## Function  \nBeta‐1,4 N‐acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of the Sd(a) histo‐blood group antigen by mediating the terminal transfer of GalNAc to acceptor glycans that contain a Neu5Acα2–3Gal moiety. This reaction occurs on both O‐ and N‐linked glycoproteins as well as on glycolipids, thereby influencing the glycan composition of numerous cell surface molecules. Expression of B4GALNT2 is highest in the colon, where it contributes to the synthesis of mucin‐type O‐glycans and core 3 structures, and it is also expressed, albeit at lower levels, in the ileum, stomach, and kidney (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). Functionally, the Sd(a) antigen has been implicated in modulating cell–cell recognition processes, protecting host cells against pathogen adhesion, and restricting influenza A virus entry through modification of host receptor glycan structures (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 10-10). In addition to its role in normal physiology, B4GALNT2 has significant implications in disease; for example, its down‐regulation in colon cancer is associated with tumor progression, whereas higher expression correlates with improved patient survival, suggesting a potential tumor‐suppressive role (duca2023thestoryof pages 3-4, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4).\n\n## Inhibitors  \nNo specific inhibitors for B4GALNT2 have been reported in the literature available from the provided sources (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4).\n\n## Disease relevance  \nAlterations in the expression of B4GALNT2 are particularly relevant to colorectal cancer. The enzyme is notably down‐regulated in colon cancer tissues compared to normal colon epithelium, and patients exhibiting higher levels of B4GALNT2 expression tend to have improved survival outcomes. This correlation supports the role of B4GALNT2 as a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 109-112, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4). Furthermore, because the enzyme’s activity influences the balance between Sd(a) and sialyl Lewis x antigens—glycan structures that are functionally antagonistic in tumor metastasis—the modulation of B4GALNT2 expression has downstream effects on cancer cell adhesion and metastatic potential (unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 109-112, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 102-106). In addition to its role in cancer, B4GALNT2‐mediated glycosylation is implicated in host protection against influenza A virus by altering glycan structures on cell surface receptors, thereby reducing viral binding and entry (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 10-10).\n\n## Other Comments  \nThe functional profile of B4GALNT2 is further diversified by its isoform complexity; alternative transcription initiation produces variants with differing cytoplasmic tail lengths, thus impacting subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and potentially interactions with other Golgi‐resident proteins (groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux‐degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). Notably, a unique non‐consensus N‐glycosylation site within the stem region is critical for proper folding and homodimer formation, providing an additional regulatory layer that distinguishes B4GALNT2 from other glycosyltransferases (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 1-3, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11). The enzyme’s tissue‐specific expression, particularly its markedly high levels in the colon, underpins its role in mucosal biology and highlights its importance in maintaining epithelial integrity. Moreover, the exquisite substrate specificity—requiring the presence of an α2,3‐linked sialic acid—ensures that B4GALNT2 selectively modifies glycan structures that are functionally essential for cell recognition and immune modulation (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). Finally, despite the absence of directly characterized inhibitors, the detailed understanding of its catalytic mechanism, domain organization, and conserved regulatory motifs establishes a robust framework for future studies that might target B4GALNT2 therapeutically in contexts such as cancer and viral infections (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Alternative names include Core2 GlcNAc‐transferase, Core 2‐branching enzyme, and Leukocyte type core 2 beta‐1,6‐N‐acetylglucosaminyltransferase (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151).\n\n## Phylogeny  \nGCNT1 is a highly conserved enzyme with orthologs identified in multiple mammalian species, including mouse, rat, and cattle, which underscores its fundamental role in mucin‐type O‐glycosylation pathways (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 15-17, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). Comparative molecular analyses indicate that GCNT1 and its isoenzymes, such as Core2GlcNAcT‐III, share significant sequence identity – approximately 40–50% identity – reflecting preserved catalytic mechanisms and substrate specificities among core‐branching glycosyltransferases (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). Phylogenetic studies place GCNT1 within a group of glycosyltransferases dedicated to the elongation and branching of O‐glycans, and its evolutionary conservation across metazoans has been emphasized by its occurrence in both invertebrate and vertebrate systems (schjoldager2020globalviewof pages 6-6, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). Furthermore, evolutionary comparisons reveal that while closely related isoforms can display tissue‐specific expression patterns, the overall conservation of the catalytic domain suggests that these enzymes arose from a common ancestral gene and have subsequently diverged to fulfill specialized functions in different cell types (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 1-2, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6).\n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nGCNT1 is classified within the CAZy glycosyltransferase family GT-14. This family is characterized by members that share a GT-A fold architecture and are generally involved in the transfer of sugar moieties with inversion of configuration; in the case of GCNT1, it specifically transfers N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-GlcNAc onto acceptor substrates (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6).\n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nGCNT1 catalyzes the reaction in which an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) unit is transferred from the donor substrate UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to the 6-hydroxyl group of the galactose residue in a mucin-type core 1 O-glycan, which is typically arranged as Galβ1-3GalNAc-Ser/Thr. The reaction can be summarized as follows:  \n  UDP-GlcNAc + Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr → UDP + Galβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1-6)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr.  \nThis branching reaction generates the core 2 structure that serves as a scaffold for further elaboration by additional glycosyltransferases, ultimately leading to the formation of complex O-glycan structures such as those presenting sialyl Lewis X epitopes (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156).\n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nA distinctive feature of GCNT1 is that its catalytic mechanism is metal ion-independent; unlike many glycosyltransferases that require divalent metal ions (such as Mn²⁺ or Mg²⁺) for activity, GCNT1 does not require exogenous metal ion cofactors for its function (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6). Instead, the enzyme relies solely on the binding of its nucleotide sugar donor, UDP-GlcNAc, and proper positioning of the acceptor substrate to facilitate the transfer reaction.\n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nGCNT1 exhibits a high degree of substrate specificity for acceptor substrates that contain the mucin-type core 1 O-glycan motif, specifically the Galβ1-3GalNAc structure linked to serine or threonine residues on glycoproteins (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). The enzyme selectively recognizes and acts on these core 1 structures, transferring GlcNAc in a β1-6 linkage to yield core 2 branched O-glycans. In addition, its activity can also extend to glycolipid substrates; for instance, GCNT1 can transfer GlcNAc to GalGb4Cer globosides, contributing to the biosynthesis of stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) determinants (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 15-17, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). Notably, the presence of specific terminal modifications on the acceptor—such as α1,2-linked fucose or α2,3-linked sialic acid on the terminal galactose—impairs the enzyme’s ability to recognize the substrate, thereby inhibiting branching (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, hodgson2023theroleof pages 9-10).\n\n## Structure  \nGCNT1 is organized as a type II transmembrane protein, a structural arrangement that is common among Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases. This organization comprises a short N-terminal cytosolic tail, a single transmembrane domain responsible for Golgi localization, a stem region that may contain N-linked glycosylation sites critical for protein stability and proper folding, and a large lumenal catalytic domain where substrate recognition and transfer occur (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). The catalytic domain adopts a GT-A fold, a structure typically characterized by a central mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices, which forms a Rossmann-like nucleotide-binding motif. Despite lacking the conventional metal ion-binding DXD motif common to many GT-A glycosyltransferases, GCNT1 utilizes a set of highly conserved catalytic residues that govern donor and acceptor recognition. Key residues identified include a free cysteine residue (Cys217), which is critical for catalysis and must remain in a reduced state, as well as residues such as Glu320 that help activate the 6-hydroxyl group of the acceptor substrate, and additional residues including Arg-254, Lys-401, and other conserved amino acids that contribute to the formation of the donor binding pocket and overall catalytic efficiency (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 25-30, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6, pak2011structuralandmechanistic pages 11-12). In support of these observations, structural studies involving crystallization of a C217S mutant have provided high-resolution insights into the active site configuration and validated the metal ion-independent catalytic mechanism (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 25-30, pak2011structuralandmechanistic pages 11-12). Moreover, AlphaFold predictions and comparative analyses with other members of the GT-14 family further corroborate the presence of a well-defined catalytic domain, with hypervariable loops that adjust to accommodate the core 1 acceptor substrates and facilitate the specific positioning of UDP-GlcNAc (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6).\n\n## Regulation  \nGCNT1 expression and activity are regulated via multiple mechanisms. Transcriptionally, the GCNT1 gene is subject to regulation by specific transcription factors such as Sp1, which has been shown to be critical for GCNT1 expression in leukocytes and epithelial cells (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 30-36). In addition, cytokines including IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15 modulate GCNT1 expression in activated CD8⁺ T-cells, aligning its expression with immune cell activation and differentiation (unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 30-36). At the post-translational level, the enzyme’s localization to the cis/medial Golgi is mediated by signals present in its transmembrane and stem domains, ensuring that its catalytic activity occurs in the appropriate subcellular compartment (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). Moreover, N-linked glycosylation sites within the stem region contribute to the enzyme’s proper folding, stability, and retention within Golgi membranes (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 2-4, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 146-148). Regulation of GCNT1 activity is also influenced by the availability of its substrates and competition with other Golgi-resident enzymes, such as sialyltransferases and fucosyltransferases, which act on similar acceptor substrates and can modulate the extent of O-glycan branching (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 143-146, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). In certain cellular contexts, such as in T-cell activation and in various cancers, upregulation of GCNT1 has been observed and is associated with altered glycan structures on the cell surface, affecting cell adhesion and signaling pathways (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 14-15, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156).\n\n## Function  \nThe primary biological function of GCNT1 is to synthesize mucin-type core 2 O-glycans by transferring an N-acetylglucosamine residue to core 1 O-glycans, thereby introducing a branched structure that can serve as a scaffold for the attachment of additional sugars. These core 2 branches are fundamental for the biosynthesis of complex glycan structures, including the generation of selectin ligands such as sialyl Lewis X, which are essential for mediating leukocyte adhesion, rolling, and extravasation at sites of inflammation (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). Expression of GCNT1 is noted in various tissues with a pronounced presence in leukocytes, particularly in activated T-cells and myeloid cells, which underscores its role in immune cell function and inflammatory responses (pqac-b010a50a, unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 30-36). In addition to its role in protein O-glycosylation, GCNT1 can also act on glycolipid substrates, facilitating the formation of branched structures on globosides that are instrumental in the biosynthesis of stage-specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1) determinants (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 15-17, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). Through these glycosylation modifications, GCNT1 influences cell–cell interactions, modulates receptor functions, and impacts processes such as lymphocyte trafficking and tissue homeostasis. In oncological contexts, aberrant expression of GCNT1 has been linked to cancer progression and metastasis, where altered glycan structures may promote tumor cell migration, immune evasion, and enhanced adhesion to stromal components (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 14-15, dimitroff2019ibranchedcarbohydratesas pages 3-4). These changes in glycosylation patterns can affect both the architecture of cell surface glycoproteins such as mucins (for example, MUC1) and the overall signaling networks that govern cell proliferation and invasion (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 14-15).\n\n## Inhibitors  \nTo date, no specific inhibitors for GCNT1 have been extensively characterized in the literature; available studies have focused primarily on its enzymatic activity and functional role rather than the development of targeted inhibitors (no valid citation provided).\n\n## Disease relevance  \nGCNT1 has been implicated in several pathological conditions owing to its critical role in glycan branching. In cancers such as colorectal, prostate, and lung carcinomas, increased expression of GCNT1 correlates with more aggressive tumor behavior, enhanced lymphatic and venous invasion, and worse patient prognosis (gupta2020asystematicreview pages 14-15, dimitroff2019ibranchedcarbohydratesas pages 3-4). This is potentially due to the alteration of the glycan structures on cell surfaces, which affect cell adhesion, migration, and interactions with immune cells. Overexpression of GCNT1 in transgenic mouse models has been linked to reduced adhesion between T-cells and their substrates, impairing immune responses and contributing to altered lymphocyte homing (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156). Moreover, dysregulation of GCNT1-mediated glycosylation has been associated with immune-related syndromes, including immunodeficiency states such as AIDS and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, where improper glycan branching may affect the display of selectin ligands critical for leukocyte recruitment (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). Although specific disease-causing mutations within the GCNT1 gene have not been elaborated in the provided context, altered expression levels and mutations in glycosyltransferases, in general, have been linked to congenital disorders of glycosylation and complex diseases affecting glycoprotein function (pqac-9a1035ae, unknownauthors2010structuralandfunctional pages 30-36).\n\n## Other Comments  \nGCNT1 is a versatile glycosyltransferase whose substrate flexibility extends beyond protein acceptors, as evidenced by its ability to utilize glycolipid substrates and oligosaccharide derivatives, thereby contributing to the structural diversification of glycoconjugates (cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 1-2, hodgson2023theroleof pages 9-10). Recombinant expression strategies have been successfully employed in both mammalian (CHO, COS-1) and insect (Sf9 via baculovirus) systems, facilitating detailed biochemical analyses and structure–function studies (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 159-161, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151). In addition, comparative studies have identified viral homologs with high sequence identity, such as those found in bovine herpesvirus 4, suggesting that the gene encoding GCNT1 may have been acquired or adapted in certain viral contexts to modulate host glycosylation pathways (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156). The enzyme’s unique metal ion-independent catalytic mechanism distinguishes it from many other glycosyltransferases and underscores a specialized catalytic strategy within the GT-A fold that is pertinent to its biological roles (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 149-151, cheng2011mucinoglycanbranching pages 4-6). Finally, the role of GCNT1 in generating scaffolds for selectin ligand synthesis not only impacts immune cell trafficking but also indicates potential therapeutic significance in managing inflammatory diseases and cancer metastasis, making it a subject of continued research interest in glycobiology (pqac-b010a50a, pqac-8888cb0b, taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 154-156).\n\nReferences\n\n1.
