  "B4GALNT1": "## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  \nB4GALNT1 is classified under EC 2.4.1.92, indicating its role in transferring hexosamine residues via a β-linkage (kellokumpu2016glycosyltransferasecomplexesin pages 3-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 10-11). This classification is based on its specificity for glycolipid substrates (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187).\n\n## Accepted name  \nThe accepted name for the enzyme is Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1, with synonyms including GM2 synthase and GalNAc-T (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187).\n\n## Phylogeny  \nB4GALNT1 is conserved across vertebrates, with orthologs in humans, mice, and rats (taniguchi2014handbookofglycosyltransferases pages 183-187).

  "B4GALNT2": "## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  \nThe accepted enzyme commission classification for Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 is EC 2.4.1.244. This classification reflects its role in transferring an N-acetylgalactosamine moiety from a nucleotide sugar donor to an acceptor glycan with a terminal sialylated galactose residue (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16).\n\n## Accepted name  \nThe recommended name for this protein is \"Beta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2.\" It is also known as Sd(a) beta-1,4-GalNAc transferase or UDP-GalNAc:Neu5Aca2-3Galb-R β1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, reflecting its function in synthesizing the Sd(a) histo-blood group antigen (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2023thestoryof pages 3-4, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Phylogeny  \nBeta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates, with documented orthologs in humans, mice, pigs, and other mammals (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). Phylogenetic analyses place this enzyme within a conserved branch of glycosyltransferases involved in glycan antigen biosynthesis on glycoproteins and glycolipids (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 16-16). It shows evolutionary relationships with paralogs like B4GALNT1, which synthesizes ganglioside GM2, but differs in catalytic specificity and tissue distribution (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). The gene is located on chromosome 17q21.33 and consists of multiple coding exons that have evolved by alternative exon usage to yield distinct isoforms (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nB4GALNT2 belongs to the glycosyltransferase family GT31 within the CAZy classification. This family includes enzymes that catalyze glycosyl transfer reactions via retaining or inverting mechanisms. B4GALNT2 is grouped with other beta-1,4-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases involved in blood group antigen and complex glycan structure biosynthesis (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-5, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 4-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16).\n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nBeta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue in a β1,4-linkage from the donor substrate UDP-GalNAc to the galactose residue of an acceptor glycan with a terminal Neu5Acα2–3 linked sialic acid. The resulting product is the Sd(a) antigen, with the structure GalNAcβ1→4(Neu5Acα2→3)Gal-R, displayed on N- and O-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nThe catalytic activity of B4GALNT2 depends on divalent metal ion cofactors, requiring ions such as Mn²⁺ (and sometimes Mg²⁺) essential for stabilizing the nucleotide sugar donor complex. The conserved DxD motif in the enzyme coordinates these metal ions, facilitating proper UDP-GalNAc binding during the transfer reaction (petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 15-16, pqac-23e3b47b).\n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nB4GALNT2 displays strict substrate specificity, requiring the acceptor substrate to have an α2,3-linked sialic acid attached to a galactose residue. It acts on multiple glycan classes, including type 1 and type 2 lactosaminic chains, core 2 and core 3 O-linked glycans, and glycolipids like sialylparagloboside. The enzyme does not transfer GalNAc to substrates with α2,6-linked sialic acids or gangliosides like GM3, emphasizing its selectivity for α2,3-sialylated structures (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 14-15, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3).\n\n## Structure  \nThe domain organization of B4GALNT2 has been characterized experimentally and through computational modeling using tools like AlphaFold2. The protein is a type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, comprising a short cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large catalytic domain in the Golgi lumen. Two major isoforms are produced by alternative first exon usage: a short form of 506 amino acids with higher enzymatic activity and a long form of 566 amino acids with an extended cytoplasmic tail critical for post-Golgi vesicle targeting (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). The catalytic domain contains typical glycosyltransferase motifs, including the conserved DxD motif for metal ion binding and UDP-GalNAc coordination, and conserved cysteine residues likely contributing to intersubunit disulfide bonding and homodimer formation (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 1-2, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). Structural modeling indicates that the catalytic pocket remains accessible despite bulky N-glycans at non-consensus N-glycosylation sites, ensuring efficient catalysis (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11). The extended cytoplasmic tail of the long isoform contains sorting signals, such as an ER-exit dibasic RGR motif and a vesicular targeting heptapeptide, facilitating localization to post-Golgi vesicles and the plasma membrane in addition to the Golgi (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 17-20, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12).\n\n## Regulation  \nRegulatory mechanisms controlling B4GALNT2 expression and activity occur at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Transcriptional regulation involves alternative promoter usage leading to distinct isoforms (exon 1S versus exon 1L), and CpG islands upstream of these exons indicate DNA methylation as an important modulator of gene expression. Transcription factors like ETS1, DMTF1, and SP1 contribute to B4GALNT2 regulation (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 17-20, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 3-4). Post-translationally, B4GALNT2 undergoes N-glycosylation at an atypical, evolutionarily conserved non-consensus N-X-C motif, critical for proper protein folding, homodimerization, stability, and Golgi targeting (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 1-3, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11). The extended cytoplasmic tail in the long isoform contains specific motifs that modulate Golgi retention and facilitate dynamic post-Golgi trafficking, underscoring the importance of subcellular localization in the enzyme’s functional regulation (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12).\n\n## Function  \nBeta-1,4 N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 plays a pivotal role in the biosynthesis of the Sd(a) histo-blood group antigen by mediating the terminal transfer of GalNAc to acceptor glycans containing a Neu5Acα2–3Gal moiety. This reaction occurs on O- and N-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids, influencing the glycan composition of numerous cell surface molecules. B4GALNT2 expression is highest in the colon, contributing to mucin-type O-glycans and core 3 structures, and is also expressed in the ileum, stomach, and kidney (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). The Sd(a) antigen modulates cell–cell recognition, protects host cells against pathogen adhesion, and restricts influenza A virus entry by modifying host receptor glycan structures (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 10-10). In disease contexts, B4GALNT2 down-regulation in colon cancer is associated with tumor progression, while higher expression correlates with improved patient survival, suggesting a potential tumor-suppressive role (duca2023thestoryof pages 3-4, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4).\n\n## Disease relevance  \nAlterations in B4GALNT2 expression are relevant to colorectal cancer. The enzyme is down-regulated in colon cancer tissues compared to normal colon epithelium, and higher B4GALNT2 expression correlates with improved survival outcomes, supporting its role as a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 109-112, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4). B4GALNT2 activity influences the balance between Sd(a) and sialyl Lewis x antigens, affecting cancer cell adhesion and metastatic potential (unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 109-112, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, unknownauthors2021…ofglycosyltransferases pages 102-106). B4GALNT2-mediated glycosylation also protects against influenza A virus by altering glycan structures on cell surface receptors, reducing viral binding and entry (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 10-10).\n\n## Other Comments  \nThe functional profile of B4GALNT2 is diversified by its isoform complexity; alternative transcription initiation produces variants with differing cytoplasmic tail lengths, impacting subcellular localization, enzymatic activity, and interactions with other Golgi-resident proteins (groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 6-9, groux-degroote2018theextendedcytoplasmic pages 9-12). A unique non-consensus N-glycosylation site within the stem region is critical for proper folding and homodimer formation, providing an additional regulatory layer distinguishing B4GALNT2 from other glycosyltransferases (cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 13-14, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 1-3, cogez2023nglycanonthe pages 9-11). The enzyme’s tissue-specific expression, particularly high levels in the colon, underpins its role in mucosal biology and highlights its importance in maintaining epithelial integrity. The substrate specificity—requiring an α2,3-linked sialic acid—ensures B4GALNT2 selectively modifies glycan structures essential for cell recognition and immune modulation (duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 7-9, dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-3, duca2023thestoryof pages 1-3). Despite the absence of directly characterized inhibitors, understanding its catalytic mechanism, domain organization, and conserved regulatory motifs establishes a framework for future studies targeting B4GALNT2 therapeutically in cancer and viral infections (dallolio2014theexpandingroles pages 3-5, duca2024thesdacarbohydrate pages 1-4, petit2021aphylogeneticview pages 9-10).\n\n## References\n1.

  "GCNT1": "## Proposed EC/sub-subclass  \n2.4.1.102\n\n## Accepted name  \nCore 2 beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase\n\n## Phylogeny  \nGCNT1 is a conserved enzyme with orthologs in mammals such as mice, rats, and cattle, highlighting its essential role in mucin-type O-glycosylation pathways. It shares significant sequence identity with isoenzymes like Core2GlcNAcT-III, indicating preserved catalytic mechanisms among core-branching glycosyltransferases. Phylogenetic studies place GCNT1 within glycosyltransferases involved in O-glycan elongation and branching, conserved across metazoans (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Glycosyltransferase family  \nGT14\n\n## Reaction Catalyzed  \nGCNT1 catalyzes the transfer of an N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) unit from UDP-GlcNAc to the 6-hydroxyl group of the galactose residue in a mucin-type core 1 O-glycan, forming the core 2 structure:  \nUDP-GlcNAc + Galβ1-3GalNAcα-Ser/Thr → UDP + Galβ1-3(GlcNAcβ1-6)GalNAcα-Ser/Thr (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Cofactor Requirements  \nGCNT1 operates independently of metal ions, unlike many glycosyltransferases that require divalent metal ions for activity (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Substrate Specificity  \nGCNT1 specifically acts on mucin-type core 1 O-glycan motifs, Galβ1-3GalNAc linked to serine or threonine residues. It can also transfer GlcNAc to glycolipid substrates like GalGb4Cer globosides, contributing to SSEA-1 determinant synthesis (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Structure  \nGCNT1 is a type II transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal cytosolic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stem region, and a large lumenal catalytic domain. The catalytic domain adopts a GT-A fold, characterized by a central mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices. Key residues include Cys217 and Glu320, essential for catalysis and substrate activation (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Regulation  \nGCNT1 expression is regulated by transcription factors like Sp1 and cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, and IL-15. Its localization to the Golgi is mediated by signals in its transmembrane and stem domains. N-linked glycosylation sites contribute to its stability and retention within Golgi membranes (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Function  \nGCNT1 synthesizes mucin-type core 2 O-glycans, crucial for generating selectin ligands like sialyl Lewis X, essential for leukocyte adhesion and extravasation. It is expressed in various tissues, notably in leukocytes, and influences immune cell function and inflammatory responses (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Disease relevance  \nIncreased GCNT1 expression is associated with aggressive tumor behavior in cancers such as colorectal, prostate, and lung carcinomas. It affects cell adhesion, migration, and immune interactions. Dysregulation of GCNT1-mediated glycosylation is linked to immune-related syndromes and congenital disorders of glycosylation (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## Other Comments  \nGCNT1's substrate flexibility extends to glycolipid substrates, contributing to glycoconjugate diversification. Its metal ion-independent catalytic mechanism distinguishes it from other glycosyltransferases, highlighting a specialized catalytic strategy within the GT-A fold (PubMed: 1329093, 23027862).\n\n## References  \n1.
